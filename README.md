# Geodata Acquisition and Utilization Semi-system
### Web-based IoT spatial soil moisture monitoring tool.

**GAUSS** (Geodata Acquisition and Utilization Semi-system) is yet another soil moisture monitoring tool. It's fully-strapped tool with some thingamajig to improve the usability of this kind of tool. We're trying to solve the problem of sudden dryness in certain areas such as Indonesia. To monitor and pinpoint which areas have the least moisture, and locate those with the most accesible way possible.

We added spatial pinpointing by using a GPS module, deployed a web application, and integrated the whole system into the webapp as well as adding an interactive map.
